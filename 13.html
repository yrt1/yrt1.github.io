<body>Preventive controls for canned peaches
Removing that extra air prevents the peaches from floating, and helps keep the canned peaches from browning over time. In many areas, this is the only method approved for entry into a state fair because it the peaches retain their quality better over time, and they’re more attractive in the jar.

Prepare the peaches: Peel the peaches, remove the pits, and slice in halves or pieces. Remove the pits from freestone peaches by cutting the fruit in half around the pit and twisting the halves in opposite directions until one side releases. Remove the pits and keep in halves or slice the peaches …

Place the sliced peaches in sterilized jars, packing them fairly tightly. Pour the hot syrup over the peaches into the jars, leaving 1/2 inch head space. Discard vanilla bean. Wipe the tops of the jars clean and cover with lids.
